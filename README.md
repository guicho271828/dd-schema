# DD-schema

This is a higher-level helper library
for [CL-CUDD](https://github.com/guicho271828/cl-cudd).

It helps defining a schema for A/B/ZDD variables that represent a certain structure,
such as numbers, symbolic variables, flags and so on.

A schema forms a tree, and a leaf node and an intermediate node in this tree is
called a leaf schema and an compound schema.
An compound schema can contain several sub-schema, similar to classes.
